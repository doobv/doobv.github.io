      <h1>My name is Andrew McFeaters</h1>
      <p>I am Andrew McFeaters, I am currently studying web development and am studying up my knowledge on html and css creation.  I am a student at Apex Friendship Highschool.  I am very interested in how this class will turn out.  Even though html is not my favorite type of work I am trying my best to get this to work.  I much perfer scripting rather than front-end web development.</p>
